## Available Skills

### AEM Edge Delivery Services

This package provides three capability areas:
- Core development workflow skills
- Discovery and documentation lookup skills
- Migration and import workflow skills

See `skills/aem/edge-delivery-services/skills/` for the current concrete skill set.

### AEM as a Cloud Service — Create Component

The `create-component` skill creates complete AEM components following Adobe best practices for AEM Cloud Service and AEM 6.5. It covers:

- Component definition, dialog XML, and HTL template
- Sling Model and optional child item model (multifield)
- Unit tests for models and servlets
- Clientlibs (component and dialog)
- Optional Sling Servlet for dynamic content

See `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/create-component/` for the skill and its reference files.

### AEM as a Cloud Service — Ensure AGENTS.md (bootstrap)

The `ensure-agents-md` skill is a **bootstrap skill** that runs first, before any other work. When a
customer opens their AEM Cloud Service project and asks the agent anything, this skill checks whether
`AGENTS.md` exists at the repo root. If missing, it:

- Reads root `pom.xml` to resolve the project name and discover actual modules
- Detects add-ons (CIF, Forms, SPA type, precompiled scripts)
- Generates a tailored `AGENTS.md` with only the modules that exist, correct frontend variant, conditional
  Dispatcher MCP section, and the right resource links
- Creates `CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md`) so Claude-based tools also discover the guidance

If `AGENTS.md` already exists it is never overwritten.

See `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/ensure-agents-md/` for the skill, template, and module catalog.

### AEM Dispatcher

Dispatcher skills are split by runtime flavor to avoid mode auto-detection and keep installation explicit.
Install only one dispatcher flavor in a workspace (`cloud-service` or `6.5-lts`).

Current dispatcher flavors:
- `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/dispatcher`
- `skills/aem/6.5-lts/skills/dispatcher`

Each flavor contains parallel capability groups (workflow orchestration, config authoring, technical advisory, incident response, performance tuning, and security hardening).
Shared advisory logic is centralized under each flavor's `dispatcher/shared/references/` to reduce duplication and drift.
